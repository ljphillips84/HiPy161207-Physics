# Analysing a solar cell with Python

When testing solar cell efficiency, we often measure its current-voltage response (or JV curve).

From this, several important parameters can be extracted:



In this exercise we will import some data and extract these parameters:

* Voc
* Jsc
* Fill Factor
* Efficiency
* Series Resistance
* Shunt Resistance
